# Subgroup-Classification-of-Medulloblastoma
This repository focusses on the development of a classification model for the subgrouping of medlluoblastoma using Illumina 450K methylation data. Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brian tumor and originally categorized into four primary molecular subgroups: WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4 each exhibiting significant molecular heterogeneity and varied survival outcomes. Accurate classification of these subgroups is crucial for optimizing treatments and improving patient outcomes. Based on the 2017 publication by E. C. Schwalbe et al., this project developed a supervised machine learning model that classify medulloblastoma samples into seven molecular subgroups: WNT, SHH-Infant, SHH-Old, Group3-LowRisk, Group3-HighRisk, Group4-LowRisk, and Group4-HighRisk, incorporating age and risk factors for enhanced subgroup differentiation. The proposed model leverages six metagenes, capturing the underlying patterns of the top 10,000 probes with the highest variances, enhancingmethylation data representation while reducing computational demands.
